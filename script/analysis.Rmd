## Hypothesis 1   
Adherence will moderate the effect of intervention condition on vocabulary outcomes for infants at 18 months, with intervention effects stronger for caregivers who adhere with the intervention.

### Prediction 1:  
The effect of intervention on infant vocabulary at 18 months will be greater for caregivers  who adhered to the intervention. 

### Analysis 1     
A principal stratification analysis will be conducted to account for varying compliance. Number of clicks will be used as a measure of compliance. A continuous propensity score will be generated using a model with number of clicks and sex, ASQ at baseline, and age of child as covariates in the intervention arm.


```{r}
##null model to compare alternate models
m0 <- glm.nb(cdi_18m ~ scale(age_of_child,scale=FALSE) + condition, data = trial_clean)
summary(m0)

#converting log odds to cohen's d
oddsratio_to_d(m0$coefficients, log = TRUE)


#Generate compliance score adherence_ps:
m_adherence_ps <-  glm.nb(click_number ~ sex_of_child + age_of_child + comm_total + gmotor_total + fmotor_total + IMD + offset(log(total_clicks)), data=trial_clean[trial_clean$condition == 1,])
summary(m_adherence_ps)

#converting log odds to cohen's d
oddsratio_to_d(m_adherence_ps$coefficients, log = TRUE)



#The continuous propensity score will then be generated for all participants in both arms of the trial
trial_clean$adherence_ps=predict(m_adherence_ps,trial_clean,type="response")

#Adherence as a covariate
m_adherence = glm.nb(cdi_18m ~ condition + adherence_ps, data = trial_clean)
summary(m_adherence)

#converting log odds to cohen's d
oddsratio_to_d(m_adherence$coefficients, log = TRUE)


#Adherence as the moderating variable
m_adherence_mod = glm.nb(cdi_18m ~ condition*adherence_ps, data = trial_clean)
summary(m_adherence_mod)

#converting log odds to cohen's d
oddsratio_to_d(m_adherence_mod$coefficients, log = TRUE)


#comparing m_compliance_mod and M0
anova(m0, m_adherence)


#choosing the best model
model.sel( m_adherence_mod, m_adherence,m0)



```

## Hypothesis 2   
The moderating effect of adherence on the effect of intervention condition will vary depending on whether caregivers have a university degree.

### Prediction 2  
a. The effect of intervention on 18 month vocab will be greater for caregivers who had higher adherence, and this interaction will be moderated by caregiver education.

b. The m_moderation model with the interactions between all three terms will have the lowest AIC value.

### Analysis 2  
A moderation analysis will be performed by fitting a Poisson regression with infant vocabulary outcomes as the outcome variable, compliance as measured by the propensity score and caregiver education as the main predictors, and the interaction term between compliance and education.
